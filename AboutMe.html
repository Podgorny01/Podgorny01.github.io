        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hello, my name is Jillian Podgorny. This is the About Me section for my personal site. I am a junior at University of Missouri - Mizzou pursuing an Environmental Science degree with an emphasis in water. After graduating, I hope to land a career in <i>water quality management</i>, preferably having to do with drinking water/water conservation. Some of my hobbies are hanging out with friends, cross stitching, playing video games, impulse buying things I don't need, and working out!</p>
